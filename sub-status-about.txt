P: PAID_UNTIL
N: NOW
E: EXPIRE_ON

PNE => CHARGEABLE (P < E)                   : usual case: new period started, can charge
PEN => CHARGEABLE (P < E)                   : debts for the time PE, thus charge even after expiration
NPE => PAID (N < P)                         : usual case
NEP => PAID (N < P) & EXPIRING ([E,N] < P)  : last payment before expiration was just made
ENP => PAID (N < P) & EXPIRING ([E,N] < P)  : last payment before expiration was just made
EPN => EXPIRED ([E,P] < N)                  : usual case


suggested provider action:
      PAID: don't charge, provide service
CHARGEABLE: charge repeatedly until status changes (to PAID or EXPIRED) of charge fails (==> on HOLD_ERROR: on provider's decision IN_SERVICE:Y/N)
EXPIRED:   don't charge, don't service


ToDo: Provider status InService.
